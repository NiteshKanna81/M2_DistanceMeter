# Distance Measurement for Measuring the Distance using ATmega328 Microcontroller

## Introduction

The main objective of this project is to measure the distance between the object/obstacle.
In this project we are using Ultrasonics sensor. Ultrasonic Sensor sends out a sound wave signal at a frequency above the range of human hearing.
Like ultrasonic sensor there are many others, we can use a transducer to transmit a pulse and to receive the echo. The Sensor determines the distance to a target by measuring time lapses between the sending and receiving of the ultrasonic pulses.

## What

- we have made a setup based on a microcontroller in which real time distance is sensed by an ultrasonic sensor and displays measured distance on an LCD display.

## Where

- It measures accurate distance using a non-contact technology - A technology that involves no physical contact between sensor and object.

## When

- In 1959, Satomura created an ultrasonic flowmeter that used doppler technology.

## Why

- I am Developing this project for easily measure the distance between objects

## How

- By using Atmega328 an display an ultrasonic sensor mainly used to determine the distance of the target object.

# Features

## Software Features

- SimulIDE tool provides ATmega, AVR, Arduino and PIC microcontrollers that can be accessed just like other components. Features like gpsim and simavr allow you to use PIC and AVR microcontrollers, respectively.
- An automatic voltage regulator (AVR) is an electronic device that maintains a constant voltage level to electrical equipment on the same load. The AVR regulates voltage variations to deliver constant, reliable power supply.

# SWOT ANALYSIS


## Strength:
- The distance to an obstacle can be measured with the low cost ultrasonic sensor . The sensors can measure distances form 2 to 400 cm with an accuracy of 3 mm. This sensors module includes ultrasonic transmitter, ultrasonic receiver and control circuit.

## Weakness:
- Although we fully believe in the capability of our sensors, we understand that ultrasonics are not suited for every application. Focuses of low thickness, similar to froth and fabric, have a tendency to assimilate sound liveliness. These materials may be hard to sense at long range.

## Opportunity:
- This project can be used as parking assistance systems in vehicles with high power ultrasonic transmitter. This Project can be used as burglar alarm with suitable additional software for homes and offices.

## Threats :
- Ultrasonic sensors must view a surface (particularly a hard, level surface) unequivocally (oppositely) to get adequate sound reverberation. Additionally, solid detecting requires a base target surface range, which is indicated for every sensor sort. If connection is wrong there might be chances of short-circuit.
